"""Note-taking tools for the researcher agent's scratchpad.

Notes are stored as SystemMessage objects in the messages list, each with a
slug-based ID. Deletion uses LangGraph's RemoveMessage to genuinely remove
the note from the agent's context window.

Why SystemMessage (not ToolMessage): OpenAI requires every tool_call in an
AIMessage to have a matching ToolMessage. If we gave the note's slug ID to
the ToolMessage and later removed it via RemoveMessage, the orphaned
tool_call would cause an API error. Instead, each tool call produces a
normal ToolMessage (auto-ID, stays in history) PLUS a separate SystemMessage
(slug ID, removable).
